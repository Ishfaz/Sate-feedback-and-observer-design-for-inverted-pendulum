# Sate feedback and observer design for inverted pendulum
Project Overview
This project focuses on the inverted pendulum system, a classic problem in control theory and robotics. The goal of the project is to design a control system that can stabilize an inverted pendulum, which is an inherently unstable system, through various control techniques.

Key Concepts:
Inverted Pendulum Dynamics
Control System Design
PID Controllers
State Feedback Control
Modeling and Simulation
