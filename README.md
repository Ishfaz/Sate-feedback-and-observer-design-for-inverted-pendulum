\section*{Project Overview}
# Sate feedback and observer design for inverted pendulum

This project focuses on the \textbf{inverted pendulum system}, a classic problem in control theory and robotics. The goal of the project is to design a control system that can stabilize an inverted pendulum, which is an inherently unstable system, through various control techniques.

\subsection*{Key Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inverted Pendulum Dynamics}
    \item \textbf{Control System Design}
    \item \textbf{PID Controllers}
    \item \textbf{State Feedback Control}
    \item \textbf{Modeling and Simulation}
\end{itemize}
